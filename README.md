#UnlambdaSimpleEnvironment#


##What is it?##

Unlambda is esoteric programming language designed by David Madore http://www.madore.org/~david/programs/unlambda/.
It is not suitable for practical purposes but programming in Unlambda may be considered as "mathematical puzzle" or
exercise in combinatory logic.

This is environment for Unlambda programs step by step evaluation.
It is implemented in Scala. It has GUI (via Scala-Swing with addition of ScalaSwingTreeWrapper).

This project uses https://github.com/kenbot/ScalaSwingTreeWrapper, build it and put jar into Unlambda-GUI/lib.
